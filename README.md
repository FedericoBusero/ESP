# Otto DIY

This Repository have all open source Arduino sketch files and basic libraries for Otto DIY an interactive robot that anyone can make!
Otto walks, dances, makes sounds and avoids obstacles. It is completely and truly open source, Arduino compatible, programmable, 3D printable. when you buy the kit, SOLDERING IS NOT REQUIRED AT ALL!

This is the beginner version of Otto DIY, we decided to leave github for the main CODES and more advanced programmers that want to suport the project. For the latest changes please go and join our [Wikifactory](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/otto-diy) is a similar platform much more easy to use, visual and simple for all the community to collaborate.

if you want to try Bluetooth connection, APP control or more sensors please go to [Otto DIY+ (PLUS) repository](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/otto-diy-plus)

Please help us to spread out the word first in Maker Faires, Maker spaces, Hacker spaces, Schools, Universities, tech events and so on...

Truly opensource hardware!

## 2. Build or make your own Otto!
Difficult to find all the parts?, please support Otto DIY and open-source hardware [by purchasing kits from our e-shop](https://ottodiy.com), it is a way to contribute and support this project to continue growing, Otto DIY invests time and resources providing this open source code, so with your help we can continue making new robots open for all.

If you want to make by your own gather all electronic parts that you'll need for this assembly, then 3D print the latest .stl files and then follow the instruction Manual PDF.

After you have all components just follow the instruction manual in the files and build your own Otto in one hour!

If you want make Otto all by yourself ;) that is great too! but do not forget to add your [marker in our google map!](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qXEfuS5egbF14gi8EUjJ6U-dITHoJJNZ&usp=sharing)

## 3. Share your innovative creation with #OttoDIY
1. A redesign, modified code or if your creation is different but inspired in Otto; is technically a remix, so please share in our [Wikifactory Social & Design Platform](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/projects)

2. Post that you have [made/remix an Otto in Thingiverse and add to this group](https://www.thingiverse.com/groups/ottodiy) 

3. Pull a request here in Github:

Contributing to this software is warmly welcomed. You can do this [basically by forking](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo), committing modifications and then [pulling requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). Please add a change log and your contact into file header.

Thanks for your contribution.

## For the quick start programming and learners
1. Download mBlock.cc Version 3; is an opensource software for easy programming Robot by Drop and Drag blocks. Based on Scratch 2.0 (MIT), beside sharing the great feature of graphical coding of Scratch, mBlock also integrates an Arduino Code generator for upload program into any Arduino based Hardware.
2. Add the Otto DIY Extension in mBlock software, swtich in the menu to Arduino mode
3. Drag and drop functions, dance, sounds and conditionals from robot Otto blocks
4. Connect, select Arduino Nano 328 and check the USB COM port
5. Upload your own code and Otto will follow each block command.

Alternatively you can use [Arduino Blocks (based on Google Blocly)](http://www.arduinoblocks.com/web/project/20999) and [Kittenblock (based on Scratch 3.0)](https://kittenbot-docs-en.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kittenbot/02InstallKittenblock.html) 

## For the advanced programmer
1. [Download & Install Arduino IDE 1.8.5 version](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) also [this driver if you have a clone board for PC] (http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_EXE.html), [or for MAC](http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_MAC_ZIP.html)
2. Copy all libraries to C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries (or wherever your library folder is installed)
3. Open  for example OttoDIY_smooth_criminal.ino, make sure in tools you have "Board: Arduino Nano" "Processor ATmega328" and your Otto is connected to the corresponding USB port
4. Upload code to your Otto and will dance!
5. Make your own dance! just modify the Arduino .ino sketch code using same libraries and functions and do not forget to share.
